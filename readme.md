As part of The Odin Project's basic Javascript tutorial I was tasked with solving the first problem from the Euler Project. I went ahead and did problems 2 and 11 as well. For problem 11, my first attempt used a more difficult(and thus slightly sloppier method) of solving the problem because at the time I had not learned of two dimensional arrays; thus once I did learn about them I went back and solved it again. So for problem 11 I have two solutions, one using a one dimensional array and another using a two dimensional array.
